Title: Creating a Simple Game Environment for Reinforcement Learning
Experimentation
Problem Statement:
Reinforcement Learning (RL) requires a simulated environment where an agent can take
actions, receive rewards, and learn from interactions. This project builds a custom
game environment using OpenAI Gym and Pygame, where an agent moves on a 5x5 grid
to reach a goal while receiving rewards. The environment is suitable for training RL
models using Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and other RL techniques.
